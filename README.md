To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
gulp dev
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use My-Component is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/my-component.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install my-component --save
```


## Usage
